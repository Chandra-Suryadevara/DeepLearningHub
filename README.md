## Introduction

Dive into the world of deep learning with our curated tutorials and mini projects. From basic neural networks to advanced deep learning architectures, this repository covers it all. You'll get hands-on experience with real-world data and learn how to build, train, and deploy deep learning models.

## Getting Started

To get the most out of this repository, you'll need to set up a Python environment and install the necessary libraries. Follow the steps below to get started.

### Setting Up the Environment

First, let's create a virtual environment to manage our project dependencies. Open your terminal or command prompt and execute the following commands:

```bash
# Create a virtual environment named 'deep_learning_env'
python -m venv deep_learning_env

# Activate the virtual environment
# On Windows
deep_learning_env\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux
source deep_learning_env/bin/activate
```

### Installing Dependencies

With the virtual environment activated, we'll now install the required libraries using `pip`. Run the following commands to install `matplotlib`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `keras`, `tensorflow`, and `jupyterlab`:

```bash
pip install matplotlib numpy scikit-learn keras tensorflow jupyterlab
```

### Opening Jupyter Notebooks

JupyterLab is a powerful interactive development environment for working with notebooks, code, and data. To open the Jupyter Notebooks provided in this repository, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
jupyter lab
```

This will launch JupyterLab in your default web browser. Navigate to the directory where you've cloned this repository, and open any of the `.ipynb` files to get started with the tutorials and projects.

## Contributing
